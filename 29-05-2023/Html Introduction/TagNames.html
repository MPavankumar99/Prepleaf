<b>
    The &lt;b&gt; HTML element is used to draw the reader's attention to the element's contents, which are not otherwise granted special importance. This was formerly known as the Boldface element, and most browsers still draw the text in boldface. However, you should not use &lt;b&gt; for styling text or granting importance.

<i>
    The &lt;i&gt; HTML element represents a range of text that is set off from the normal text for some reason, such as idiomatic text, technical terms, taxonomical designations, among others. Historically, these have been presented using italicized type, which is the original source of the &lt;i&gt; naming of this element.

<u>
    The &lt;u&gt; HTML element represents a span of inline text which should be rendered in a way that indicates that it has a non-textual annotation. This is rendered by default as a simple solid underline, but may be altered using CSS.

    The &lt;br&lt; HTML element produces a line break in text (carriage-return). <br>It is useful for writing a poem or an address, where the division of lines is significant.
